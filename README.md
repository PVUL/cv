### Basics:

I'm Korean American, from Philadelphia, and I grew up in the 80's. I spent most of my life in the east coast (of the US)- Philly, New York, and Boston. Now, I'm based out of LA (the winters turned me).

### Interests:

Practical use-cases for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), lifecycle of data (posthumous), mental well-being, 2nd brain PKMs, biomimetics, objective personality typing, generative art, electric skateboards, Rust, Typescript

### My workstyle:

I prefer asynchronous collaboration and working remotely. I am very upfront and I take pride in delivering quality work. Sometimes, my dedication to finish projects drains me, and burns me out. I say this in hopes to find a team that values each team member as a human being, so we can treat eachother with the same care as we treat our work.

## Current Projects

ASYLM Collective is an artist collective that I am working on with several engineers and artists. Our mission is to express our understanding of technology through digital art and installations in areas related to the future of home, music, art, fashion, and food. We intend to create compelling experiences that initiate discussions of where we are headed, as a species, and to inspire future generations.

## Past Work

### 2020-2022 | Academia + teaching

From September 2021 to June 2022, I worked at [UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Design](https://www.aud.ucla.edu/) as a Technology Manager and Creative Technologist. I managed the fabrication lab, including 3d printers, a woodshop, a CNC Router, and laser cutters, as well as the robotics lab. I had 9 work-study students that reported to me on special projects to help improve the program. I trained all the students on safety and equipment-use. Some cool projects (from grad students) I provided guidance on: AR-based animations super-imposed on top of physical architectural models, running grasshopper scripts on robot arms for clay extrusions, and large-scale projection mapping installations.

_Technologies: Rhino, RhinoCAM, Grasshopper, Unity, C#, Maya, Solidworks, Adobe Illustrator, 3d printing_

In 2020, I started teaching part-time at [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/), an online bootcamp. I taught HTML/CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, and React. Classes were through Zoom, and the curriculum was managed through MoodleCMS. I provided optional office hours to make sure students were not falling behind. I'm proud that I received high marks on my teaching skills from my students.

_Technologies: React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap_

### 2019-2020 | [Almanac](https://almanac.io/)

In 2019, I was the first Fullstack Engineer hired at Almanac. Almanac is focused on building almost like a Github for documents. While I was there, I helped build out many of the core feature sets of their documentation platform such as the homepage, registration, onboarding, admin panel, company portal, Cloudinary integrations. I mentored junior engineers, conducted interviews for engineering candidates, and created onboarding guide for team members.

_Technologies: Typescript, React, Ruby, Rails, Redis, PostgreSQL, Algolia, AWS, Cloudinary API, Heroku_

### 2016-2019 | [Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/)

In 2016, I joined Wayfair as a Software Engineer and it's where I nurtured most of my coding ethos, as well as learning how to build quality apps at scale (ie. millions of users). I started off on the Registry team (as in wedding registry) and built a gift delivery tracking system. I then worked on the Chat team, and helped create the messaging feature on the Wayfair app. I coined our chat match-making algorithm as "Sorting Chat" (for Harry Potter fans).

I then joined the Next team (aka Wayfair R&D), where our goal was to create the next generation of shopping experiences. This is where I got to work on some really cool shit! I worked on a 3d scanning pipeline using photogrammetry and GCP, and trained our off-shore artists in Vietnam to create high-fidelity 3d models from our scans to be used for site imagery, and virtual assets in our AR/VR experiences. Another project I worked on (one of my favorite projects of all time) was projection mapping onto furniture, which showcased 100's of different print patterns on the same piece of furniture, blending the virtual and physical worlds together, and felt like the perfect fuse of art and technology.

I trained junior engineers, helped interview candidates, mentored interns, and gave talks at college hackathons to promote our 3d model API. I was also the head organizer for the [company hackathon](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/culture/hacker-culture-at-wayfair) for 2 years- coordinating workshops, volunteers, and logistics for 200+ participants, as well as involving the company founders and C-level executives.

### 2015-2016 | Coding bootcamp + a few startups

In 2015, I attended a coding bootcamp in Boston called Launch Academy, where I learned Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. It felt like 2 years of knowledge packed into 20 weeks. But I knew that's where I had to be, because I was determined based on [my hackathon experience](#2012-2014--my-failed-startup--winning-a-hackathon) a few years prior.

After I finished the bootcamp, I worked out of the coworking space, Wework, and it seemed to be a case of being at the right place at the right time. I helped make websites and apps for several startups in the coworking space, such as [Big Word Club](https://bigwordclub.com/) (a site serving educational content for kids) and an app called Pinch (like Task Rabbit). Both used the same backend stack- Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

_Technologies: Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Heroku, Stripe API, Vimeo API_

### 2014-2015 | Hardware engineering

In 2014, I moved from NYC to Boston to work for startup Padloc (now [Aila](https://ailatech.com/)) as a Senior Design Engineer - I designed an iPad enclosure for a bar scanning kiosk for our clients Target, PacSun, and Wework. We worked out of the Bolt Hardware Accelerator space, where I designed many concepts and prototyped our designs. We used sandcasting to get high-quality, low-volume units manufactured. Performed tolerance stack analysis, and implemented best practices for CAD collaborative project management.

In late 2014, I eventually left Padloc and joined a similar sounding startup called [Pavlok](https://pavlok.com/) (no relation) designing their product packaging. In addition to designing, I prototyped the concepts with 3d printing, designed graphics, procured a supplier in China to manufacture the packaging within our target budget, and made sure quality met our specs.

### 2012-2014 | My (failed) startup + winning a hackathon

In 2012, I had an idea for a novel auto-winding charging cable for smartphones. So after designing and prototyping it out of my bedroom, and getting turned down for a bank loan, I turned to Kickstarter, and I was able to crowdfund $50k. That allowed for first batch production of my original design at a factory that I vetted in China. However, due to higher than expected COGS (Cost Of Goods Sold), I was unable to keep the doors of my startup open, and had to ultimately shut it down. I learned a lot of invaluable skills, and the biggest takeaway was that I definitely need help sometimes (ie. in business and marketing), I'm just not fit to be a solopreneur, and I'm fine with that.

_Technologies: Solidworks, Illustrator, Photoshop, 3d printing_

In 2013, I attended my first hackathon, it was the [NY Fashion Week Hackathon](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/founders-of-swatchit-paul-yun-jackson-lin-ramzi-abdoch-news-photo/161700364). I designed the UX for my team's project, as the Product Designer on the team. Our team ended up winning the top prize of $10k, and we even got to meet the founder of Foursquare! However, the developers on the team didn't believe that we could turn it into a business, so it died there. I knew from that moment, that I needed to become a developer one day.

### 2010-2012 | Designing ergonomics

In 2010, I originally worked at Ergotech in Westchester, NY, as a Freelance Product Designer. Apple had just released the first iPad, and I was tasked with designing an iPad stand. After the leadership saw my designs and prototypes, they asked me not only join, but to lead their engineering team (tbh it was only a 2-person team). I was head of product design and engineering and worked on several product lines, including monitor mounts, mission-critical power (for financial industries), and tablet accessories. We received high marks from [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/videos/versastand-turns-your-ipad-into-a-piece-of-desk-furniture/) on the iPad stand design.

### 2006-2009 | My first gigs

In 2006, I worked at [Target](https://www.target.com/) at their HQ in Minneapolis, MN as an Intern Design Engineer in the Fixture Design department. I created documentation for how installations should be installed at local stores. Target had just had designed an all-plastic, non-rusting shopping cart, and I was tasked with designing a cup holder that would attach to this novel shopping cart. I created a number of concept drawings, and worked with the senior engineers to prototype the best concepts. Several years later, I was awarded a utility patent (my first patent!) and if you're lucky you may see [the red cup holder](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/e0/62/d3e0627b9206758fa512cab8a68f711e.jpg) at participating stores.

In 2007, my first fulltime job was at [American Standard](https://www.americanstandard-us.com/) in Piscataway, NJ. I worked as a Product Development Engineer to help improve production yields of toilet manufacturing from our factories in Mexico. I created engineering drawings of our products which were used to verify quality at the factory level. For a 23-year-old, it was an amazing opportunity to have company paid trips out to Mexico many times, and even to China (by myself!) to make sure our products met our high level of quality. I was also involved with procurement, as I looked for ways the company could save money on product components without sacrificing performance. I was able to save the company $0.5M in my first year.

### 2003-2007 | Education

In 2007, I graduated from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://rpi.edu/) in Troy, NY with a double major in Mechanical Engineering and Product Design (aka B.S. Science, Technology & Society). I was a B student.
