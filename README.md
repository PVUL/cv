### **Creative Technologist**, Sep 2021 - Jun 2022

[UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Design](https://www.aud.ucla.edu/) ∙ Los Angeles, CA

In 2021, I joined UCLA's School of Architecture and Urban Design as a Creative Technologist. I managed the fabrication lab, including 3d printers, a woodshop, a CNC Router, and laser cutters, as well as the robotics lab. I had 9 work-study students that reported to me on special projects to help improve the program. I trained all the students on safety and equipment-use. Some cool projects (from grad students) I provided guidance on: AR-based animations super-imposed on top of physical architectural models, running grasshopper scripts on robot arms for clay extrusions, and large-scale projection mapping installations.

## 2016-2020: _Working at tech companies_

<br>

### **Senior Software Engineer**, Aug 2019 - Sep 2020

[Almanac](https://almanac.io/) ∙ San Francisco, CA

In 2019, I was the first Fullstack Software Engineer hire at Almanac. While I was there, I helped build out many of the core feature sets of their documentation platform such as the homepage, registration, onboarding, admin panel, company portal, Cloudinary integrations.

### **Senior Software Engineer**, May 2016 - Aug 2019

[Wayfair](https://www.wayfair.com/) ∙ Boston, MA

In 2016, I joined Wayfair as a Software Engineer and it's where I nurtured most of my coding ethos, as well as learning how to build quality apps at scale (ie. millions of users). I started off on the Registry team (as in wedding registry) and built a gift delivery tracking system. I then worked on the Chat team, and helped create the messaging feature on the Wayfair app. I coined our chat match-making algorithm as "Sorting Chat" (for Harry Potter fans).

I then joined the Next team (Wayfair R&D), where our goal was to create the next generation of shopping experiences. This is where I got to work on some really cool shit! I worked on a 3d scanning pipeline using photogrammetry and GCP, and trained our off-shore artists in Vietnam to create high-fidelity 3d models from our scans to be used for site imagery, and virtual assets in our AR/VR experiences. Another project I worked on (one of my favorite projects of all time) was projection mapping onto furniture, which showcased 100's of different print patterns on the same piece of furniture using Unity and 3d scanning.

I was the head organizer of the company hackathon [WayfairHacks](https://www.aboutwayfair.com/culture/hacker-culture-at-wayfair) for 2 years- coordinating workshops, volunteers, and logistics for 200+ participants, as well as involving the company founders and C-level executives. I also trained junior engineers, interviewed candidates, mentored interns, performed code reviews, and gave talks at college hackathons to promote Wayfair's 3d model API.

### **Apprentice Rails Developer**, May 2015 - July 2015

[Launch Academy](https://launchacademy.com/) ∙ Boston, MA

In 2015, I attended a coding bootcamp called Launch Academy where I learned Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. I collaborated with other developers through pair programming to create a restaurant review site, and used Trello to implement Agile methodologies to deliver the product on time. It felt like 2 years of knowledge packed into 20 weeks, but I knew that's where I had to be because I was determined based on [my hackathon experience](#my-first-hackathon-feb-2013) a few years prior.

_Technologies: Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, JQuery, CSS, Git, RSpec, Capybara_

<br>

### **Packaging Engineer**, Apr 2015 - May 2016

[Pavlok](https://pavlok.com/) ∙ Boston, MA

In late 2015, I joined startup Pavlok designing their product packaging for retail. In addition to designing, I prototyped the concepts with 3d printing, designed graphics, procured a supplier in China to manufacture the packaging within our target budget and timeline, and made sure quality was up to our specs.

## 2012-2014: _My (failed) startup + winning a hackathon_

<br>

### **CEO & Founder**, Sep 2012 - Dec 2014

Escargot ∙ New York, NY

In 2012, I had an idea for a novel auto-winding charging cable for smartphones. So after designing and prototyping it out of my bedroom, and getting turned down for a bank loan, I turned to Kickstarter, and I was able to crowdfund $50k. That allowed for first batch production of my original design at a factory that I vetted in China. However, due to higher than expected COGS (Cost Of Goods Sold), I was unable to keep the doors of my startup open, and had to ultimately shut it down. I learned a lot of invaluable skills, and the biggest takeaway was that I definitely need help sometimes (ie. in business and marketing), I'm just not fit to be a solopreneur, and I'm fine with that.

_Technologies: Solidworks, Illustrator, Photoshop, 3d printing_

<br>

### **My first hackathon**, Feb 2013

In 2013, I attended the [NY Fashion Week Hackathon](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/founders-of-swatchit-paul-yun-jackson-lin-ramzi-abdoch-news-photo/161700364) with a few of my friends. I designed the UX for my team's project, as the Product Designer on the team. The project was called `SWATCHit`, and it helped facilitate communication between fashion designers and artisans across the world to speed up product development cycles, and allow designers to stay focused on their creativity's stream of consciousness. Our team ended up winning the top prize of $10k, and we even got to meet the founder of Foursquare! However, the developers on the team didn't believe that we could turn it into a business at the time- so it died there. I knew from that moment, that I needed to become a developer one day.

## 2010-2012: _Designing ergonomics_

<br>

### **Director of Engineering**, Sep 2010 - Aug 2012

Ergotech ∙ Elmsford, NY

In 2010, I worked at Ergotech, originally as a Freelance Product Designer to design an iPad stand. After the leadership saw my designs and prototypes, they were impressed and asked me not only join full-time, but to lead their engineering team. I was head of product design and engineering and worked on several product lines, including monitor mounts, mission-critical power (for financial industries), and tablet accessories. Implemented a supplier-selection criteria program, managed product quality control, and certified our products through industry UL/CSA safety regulations. We received high marks from [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/videos/versastand-turns-your-ipad-into-a-piece-of-desk-furniture/) on the iPad stand design.

## 2006-2009: _My first gigs_

<br>

### **Product Development Engineer**, Aug 2007 - Feb 2009

**[American Standard](https://www.americanstandard-us.com/)** ∙ Piscataway, NJ

In 2007, my first fulltime job was at American Standard. I worked as a Product Development Engineer to help improve production yields of toilet manufacturing from our factories in Mexico. I created engineering drawings of our products which were used to verify quality at the factory level. For a 23-year-old, it was an amazing opportunity to have company paid trips out to Mexico many times, and even to China to make sure our products met our high level of quality. I was also involved with procurement, as I looked for ways the company could save money on product components without sacrificing performance. I was able to save the company $0.5M in my first year.

_Technologies: Solidworks, Pro/Engineer, AutoCAD, ANSYS_

<br>

### **Intern Design Engineer**, May 2006 - August 2006

**[Target](https://www.target.com/)** ∙ Minneapolis, MN

In 2006, I worked at Target in the Fixture Design department. I created techincal documentation for how installations should be installed at local stores. Target had just had designed an all-plastic, non-rusting shopping cart, and I was tasked with designing a cup holder that would attach to this novel shopping cart. I created a number of concept drawings, and worked with the senior engineers to prototype the best concepts. Several years later, I was awarded a utility patent (my first patent!) and if you're lucky you may see [the red cup holder](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d3/e0/62/d3e0627b9206758fa512cab8a68f711e.jpg) at participating stores.
